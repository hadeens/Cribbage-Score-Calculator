For the following input hand cases, I would love if you had a deck of cards and actually shuffle and deal them out.

2 players, Input Hand
- deal two piles of 6 cards. Input your own hand first.
- choose a random starter from the remaining cards in the deck. Input this card on the next screen after choosing a hand.
- you can then restart the application and input the opponent's hand and the same starter you just choose
- compare the results and see if you won the round!

3 players, Input Hand
- deal two piles of 5 cards. Input your own hand first.
- choose a random starter from the remaining cards in the deck. Input this card on the next screen after choosing a hand.

- compare the results and see if you won the round!
